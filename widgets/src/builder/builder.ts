/**
 * Full-screen Dashboard Builder overlay.
 *
 * Where it runs: in the browser, inside a ThingsBoard CE page. The code is part of the shared
 * IIFE bundle (`widgets/dist/imex-dbb.js`) embedded in each custom widget type (DECISIONS D-010).
 * The builder is not a widget itself: it appends a fixed overlay `<div class="dbb-root dbb-overlay">`
 * to `document.body` and removes it on close.
 *
 * Main export: `openBuilder(options)`. Callers:
 *   - `entries/launcher.ts` `open()` - the navbar edit menu's "Dashboard Builder" item
 *     (also reachable via `window.IMEX_DBB.open`).
 *   - `entries/renderer.ts` - "Edit this dashboard" on the machine page.
 * Both pass an `onClose(changed)` callback so the page can refresh after a save/apply/delete.
 *
 * Modules it calls:
 *   - `core/store`  - load/save/apply/delete dashboards and resolve what a machine shows. Every
 *                     write goes to ThingsBoard attributes over REST with the user's own JWT
 *                     (storage layout: DECISIONS D-013).
 *   - `core/chat`   - chat turns via the rule-chain relay (D-014).
 *   - `core/schema` - Dashboard/Widget types, limits (MAX_WIDGETS, MAX_KEYS, MAX_DEVICES) and
 *                     `checkDashboard` (D-020).
 *   - `core/compat` - which property kinds each widget type accepts (D-020).
 *   - `core/scope`  - the user's machine tree (from `selectedNodes`, D-011).
 *   - `core/audit`  - `dbb_audit` entries for save/apply/restore/delete/chat (D-012).
 *   - `render/grid` - the 12-column drag/resize canvas; `render/*` draws the widget cards.
 *   - `./editors`   - Style / Colours / Theme / rich-text sub-editors; `./ui` - modal, toast.
 *
 * Key concepts and data flow:
 *   - `draft` is the in-memory Dashboard being edited. Nothing reaches ThingsBoard until Save
 *     (or Apply / Restore / Delete, which write immediately).
 *   - `baseline` is the JSON of the last loaded/saved draft; `dirty()` compares against it.
 *   - Undo/redo are stacks of JSON snapshots (max 50). `commit`/`mutate` push one snapshot per
 *     change and redraw everything. `quiet`/`quietWidget` are for sub-editors: they coalesce
 *     rapid edits from the same source into one undo step and do not rebuild the right panel,
 *     so inputs keep focus.
 *   - Layout: top bar (machine, name, time range, tools), banner row, left palette, centre
 *     canvas (Grid), right panel (Widget/Dashboard settings, Style, Colours, Chat tabs).
 *   - Save validates with `checkDashboard`, stores via `store.saveDashboard` (optimistic
 *     concurrency on `version`), then on first save / chat proposal / save-as opens the Apply
 *     dialog (D-017).
 *
 * Security: the role checks here (`openBuilder`: dashboards.build; delete: owner or dashboards.deleteAny; apply and
 * shared saves: dashboards.applyMany; D-050) are UI-only.
 * CE lets any customer user write these attributes through REST (DECISIONS D-012).

   *
   * Steps, in order:
   *   1. A role without `dashboards.applyMany` editing a shared dashboard (used by several machines, or applied to a
   *      location or the customer) -> offer "Save as copy" instead (D-015, D-050): changing it would change it for
   *      many machines, which is what that permission guards.
   *   2. Validate with `checkDashboard` (D-020 limits and property/widget compatibility) and
   *      require at least one widget; problems are shown as a toast and nothing is written.
   *   3. Save as: ask for a name and turn the draft into a new dashboard (new id, version 0).
   *   4. For machine dashboards, warn if some same-type machines (first 50) don't report a used
   *      property (REST: one resolve + key list per machine; slow on the demo server).
   *   5. `store.saveDashboard` (optimistic concurrency on `version`). On ConflictError the user
   *      can reload the other version or save theirs as a copy.
   *   6. On first save, a pending chat apply proposal, or save-as, open the Apply dialog (D-017).
   * Writes a `dashboard.save` / `dashboard.saveAs` audit entry.
   *
   * @param asCopy true for "Save as" (always creates a new dashboard).
