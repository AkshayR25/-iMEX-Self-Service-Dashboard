// core/scope.ts — the user context: who is logged in, WHAT they may do (role), WHERE they may look (access), the
// hierarchy they see, the customer's DashboardStore asset and the property catalogue (DECISIONS D-011, D-018, D-050).
//
// Main exports:
//   loadUserContext()   builds a UserContext
//   loadPerms()         the role only (D-052: no tree, no relations)
//   liveKeys()          merges the machines' live telemetry keys into ctx.profileKeys (the only other network I/O)
//   clearRelCache()     drops the cached scope relations
//   isGrantedMachine / isVisibleNode / holdsAll / devicesUnder / allDevices / ancestors / pathLabel / siblings /
//   nearest / nodesContaining
//                       pure queries over the loaded tree (no network)
// Called by: entries/common.ts `userContext()` (which caches ONE context per page for 5 minutes,
// or until forced), then passed to everything in core/store.ts, core/chat.ts, the builder and the
// renderer. This module itself does not cache (the relations and the role store aside, below).
//
// How the context is built (D-050: the shared access and role cores, core/access.ts and core/perm.ts, the same rules as
// the iMEX app's widgets and the Reports and AI services):
//   1. GET /api/auth/user, then the user's SERVER_SCOPE attributes (one read: imexAccess, selectedNodes, imexRole,
//      Role, dbbAdmin, names, dbb_personal).
//   2. WHERE = `imexAccess` ({ v: 1, grants: [{ id, type, mode }] }); while it is absent, the legacy `selectedNodes`
//      (every shape seen so far; entries without an id are matched by name, then label, among the customer's assets
//      and devices). An unreadable imexAccess, or none at all, is NO equipment (fail closed). An ASSET 'all' grant is
//      the asset and everything below it, now and later; a DEVICE grant is that machine only.
//   3. WHAT = the role: `imexRole` looked up in the role store `imexRoles` on the customer's "System Configuration"
//      asset (or the app's sessionStorage copy `imex-roles:<customerId>`, 2 minutes); without imexRole the legacy
//      `Role` / `dbbAdmin` (Admin, Customer Admin, Administrator or dbbAdmin = Admin; anything else = Viewer). No store
//      (POC customers) = the built-in Admin and Viewer. `ctx.perms` answers page / can / canState; the Builder's
//      three flags are `canBuild` (dashboards.build), `canApplyMany` (dashboards.applyMany) and `canDeleteAny`
//      (dashboards.deleteAny). `isAdmin` is kept one release as an alias of canBuild.
//   4. Tenant-admin mode (D-018): a TENANT_ADMIN is unrestricted (every page, every action, every machine). The
//      widget setting `customerId` picks the customer; its top-level assets become 'all' grants. D-052: the tops and
//      their trees are the iMEX app's (imxShell.scopeTree: `imex-tops:<userId>` and the shared relations entry of
//      every top, FROM only), read or written here in the same shape (tenantTree): no relation request when the app
//      has just read them, else one per top; no walk up from each asset (only when the tops cannot be read).
//      `loadPerms()` is the role alone (no tree), for the headless launcher's isEditor().
//   5. Tree = ONE relations query per grant in each direction (FROM below an ASSET 'all' grant: assets and devices;
//      TO above every grant: assets), then ONE Entity Data Query per entity type for names, labels, profiles and the
//      `dbb_assign` attributes (D-022). The access core resolves it: `ctx.nodes` = the granted machines, the assets
//      under 'all' grants, and the NAV nodes (the ancestors of every grant, `nav: true`): shown as the path, nothing
//      below them is granted by them, and their children list only what the user sees. `ctx.rootIds` = the visible
//      tops; `ctx.allRoots` = the 'all' grants; `ctx.coversAll` = every top of the organisation is an 'all' grant
//      (required for customer-wide assignments).
//   6. Ancestors above the visible tops that are not in the tree (none in a normal hierarchy: the TO walk reaches the
//      top) stay in `aboveRoot`, with their `dbb_assign` (a location assignment above the user's scope still applies,
//      store.resolveForDevice).
//   7. Store = first asset of type `DashboardStore` assigned to the customer; one read of its attributes
//      `dbb_profile_keys` ({ [profile]: KeyMeta[] }, the property catalogue for the builder and chat),
//      `dbb_assign_customer`, `dbb_assign_rev` and `dbb_lib_version`.
//   Calls for a customer user with one grant: 9, in 4 rounds (auth user; user attributes + store lookup + role store;
//   2 relations queries + store attributes; 2 entity queries); 8 when the app's role store copy is fresh.
//   Problems are collected in `warnings` (shown by the UI) instead of throwing, where possible.
//   8. Not part of the load: `liveKeys(ctx, types)` adds the keys the machines actually send to `ctx.profileKeys`
//      (the catalogue is only an overlay for names and units, 9 Oct 2026). The builder, the chat and the default
//      machine page await it; it is cached per browser session.
//
// SECURITY: in ThingsBoard CE this scope and the role are enforced by the UI only (D-011, D-012, D-050). A customer user
// can read every device of their customer through the REST API and can write their own user attributes.
